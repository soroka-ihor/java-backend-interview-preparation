# Design patterns

### 1. Explain S.O.L.I.D principles.
- S – Single responsibility  this principle states that a class should only have one responsibility 
- O – Open to extensions, close to modifications. In this principle we don’t modify our classes (just in case when we’re fixing bugs), but extend them;
- L – Liskov substitution. In this principle we should provide possibility to replace child classes with their parents without causing behavior of the application. Example with Bird, FlyingBird and Penguin;
- I – Interface segregation. Split big interfaces to a smallest ones;
- D – Dependency Inversion. Means being dependent on an abstract class/interface, and not on specific implementation.

### 2. Tell about patterns that you know. Give examples of use.
### 3. Explain DRY, DIE, KISS, YAGNI
