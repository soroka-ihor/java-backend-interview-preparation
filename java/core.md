> #### Which memory types JAVA has? Tell about JAVA memory model.
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
[JVM memory model](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/java-jvm-memory-model-memory-management-in-java) has two major memory types:

- Heap
- Stack

Heap in turns is divided to a few part such as `young generation` and `old generation`. Heap is used by java to allocate
memory to Objects. Any new object is always created in the heap.
Stack memory is used for storing values for invoking methods: it holds local primitives and links to objects in heap.
