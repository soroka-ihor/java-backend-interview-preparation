> #### Explain exception hierarchy.
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
In the top of hierarchy stays Throwable. Then this interface gets extended by Exception and Error. Exception is used for 
conditions that the application may need to handle. Error indicates about serious JVMâ€™s problems such as OutOfMemoryException, 
Could not be handled. RuntimeException for conditions that may occurs during runtime. Not checked.

> ####  Explain try-with-resources. Interface Autocloseable.
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Try-with-resources statement is used for such objects that must be closed after they give their data. These objects must 
implement interface Autocloseable. Example: FileReader

> #### What is diamond problem? Why they introduced default methods in an interface?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Diamond problem occurs upon multiple inheritance, when two or more parent classes have the same method signature.
Can be solved by switching to interfaces
